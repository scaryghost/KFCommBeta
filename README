Install:
Copy the contents into the system folder to your Killing Floor system folder.

Usage:
The KFCommBeta mutator is designed to be used with Marco's Server Side 
Perks mutator.  You can download that mutator here:

To add the community perks, edit the ServerPerks ini file and add:

    Perks=KFCommBeta.KFCBVetBerserker
    Perks=KFCommBeta.KFCBVetSupport
    Perks=KFCommBeta.KFCBVetSharpshooter
    Perks=KFCommBeta.KFCBVetFirebug
    Perks=KFCommBeta.KFCBVetDemolitions
    Perks=KFCommBeta.KFCBVetCommando

Because the perks that are packaged with the Server Perks mutator are not 
up to date with the 1017 changes, I have packaged them in the .u file as 
well.  Added these lines in the ini file to access them:

    Perks=KFCommBeta.KF1017VetBerserker
    Perks=KFCommBeta.KF1017VetCommando
    Perks=KFCommBeta.KF1017VetFieldMedic
    Perks=KFCommBeta.KF1017VetFirebug
    Perks=KFCommBeta.KF1017VetSharpshooter
    Perks=KFCommBeta.KF1017VetDemolitions
    Perks=KFCommBeta.KF1017VetSupport

The mutator itself will replace the default weapons with modded ones.  It 
will also overwerite the specimen classes and use the beta specimens.
